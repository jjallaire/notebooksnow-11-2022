## What is Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that builds on standard markdown with features essential for scientific communication.

-   Computations: Python, R, Julia, Observable JS
-   Markdown: [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) w/ many enhancements
-   Output: Documents, presentations, websites, books, blogs

Literate programming system in the tradition of Org-mode, Sweave, Weave.jl, R Markdown, iPyPublish, Jupyter Book, etc.

## Origins

-   Open source project sponsored by Posit, PBC (formerly RStudio, PBC)
-   10 years of experience with R Markdown (a similar system that was R-specific) convinced us that the core ideas were sound.
-   The number of languages and runtimes used for scientific discourse is very broad.
-   Quarto is a ground-up re-imagining of R Markdown that is fundamentally multi-language and multi-engine.

## Goal: Computational Documents

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Documents that incorporate the source code required for their production
-   Notebook and plain text flavors
-   Automation and reproducibility

## Computational Engines

Quarto has a pluggable computation system that allows for compatibility with today's standards along with the ability to evolve to work with new standards:

-   Knitr
-   Jupyter
-   Observable JS
-   Others possible...

## Knitr Engine {.nostretch}

![](images/rstudio-qmd-how-it-works.png){width=90%}

For R, Quarto still uses Knitr under the hood. Consequently, ***the vast majority of existing Rmd files*** can be rendered unmodified.

## Jupyter Engine --- ipynb {.nostretch}

![](images/qmd-how-it-works.png){width=90%}

Use with any language that has a Jupyter kernel (Python, Julia, R, many others....). Supports two input file formats:

-   Traditional notebooks (`.ipynb`)
-   Markdown w/ chunks (`.qmd`)

Hello Jupyter: <https://quarto.org/#hello-quarto>

## Jupyter Engine: ipynb {.nostretch}

You can also render Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb` files) directly. Note that in this case no execution occurs by default:

## Goal: Scientific Markdown

## Markdown Extensions 

-   Citations
-   Cross references
-   LaTeX math
-   Diagrams
-   Figure panels
-   Callouts
-   Advanced page layout


## Goal: Single Source Publishing

## Publishing Formats

-   Documents (HTML, PDF, Word, ODT, Ipynb, etc.)

-   Presentations (HTML, PDF, PowerPoint, etc.)

-   Websites & Blogs (Quarto, Hugo, Docusaurus, etc.)

-   Books (HTML, PDF, Word, ePub, Asciidoc, etc.)

-   Journal Articles (LaTeX, HTML, Ipynb, etc.)


## Notebooks and Quarto

Ways you might use Jupyter notebooks with Quarto:

- **Authoring**---Using notebooks as an end-to-end authoring tool for a manuscript.

- **Computations**---Using notebooks as source of reproducible computations for a manuscript.

- **Publishing**---Providing interactive supplements to manuscripts published in print or on the web.



## Notebook Authoring

Author the entire manuscript within a notebook editor like Jupyter Lab (side by side preview for HTML or PDF output):


![](images/jupyterlab-preview.png){width="80%" fig-align="center"}



## Notebook Computations

::: columns

::: {.column width="55%"}
- Notebook as a computational medium only (as opposed to a medium for both prose and computation)

- Staged workflow where computations are  _included_ within documents for publication (retaining ability to re-execute computations for reproducibility)

## Notebook Computations (cont.) 

::: columns

::: {.column width=60%}
Markdown document includes figure from notebook:

````{.markdown code-line-numbers="|6"}
For a demonstration of a line plot on a 
polar axis, see @fig-polar.

::: {#fig-polar}

{{< include notebook.ipynb#fig-polar >}}

## Notebook Publishing

Create notebook output _alongside_ traditional formats (LaTeX, HTML, etc.). For example, here is metadata for an American Chemical Society article that produces multiple outputs:

```{.yaml code-line-numbers="|2-7|8-10|11-13"}
format:
  acs-pdf:
    keep-tex: true
    journal:
      id: jacsat 
      layout: traditional 
      abbreviations: IR,NMR,UV
  acs-html: 
    fig-width: 6
    fig-height: 4
  ipynb: 
    fig-width: 7
    fig-height: 5
```
